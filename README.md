# gruglb

A simplistic L4 load balancer, written in Rust, for [grug brain developers](https://grugbrain.dev/) (me).

# Why?

This is mainly a toy project, but also provides a nice segway into being able to use a simple load balancer without many frills for my own projects and to learn
about writing more complex systems in Rust.
